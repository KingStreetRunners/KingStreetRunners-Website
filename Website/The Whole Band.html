		<h1>About the Band</h1>
	<br>
		<h4>It all started one night in the wonderfull town of Greenock. One very intelligent man had the idea to start a band. It was a day in the winter of<br>1995 when Colin rode into town on his donkey. Paul sat with the only instrument left in this one-quitar town, the Microphone, and ordered<br>a drink.
		He had barely set foot inside the inn when a local ruffian, Mark, took a liking to his taste in music.
		'I do like your music style,' said<br>Mark, because he believed in speaking his mind. 'What's your name, stranger?'</h4>
		<h4>From there on out, Mark and Paul were and are still are best of pals! Whenever KSR releases a new single, they always listen together.</h4>
		<h4>All of the other members of the band were regulars at Marks bar. They had heard of Pauls unique style of music and had all taking an<br>interest to it. When Mark had introduced Paul to the others, he was scheptical. He didn't know how to feel about strangers, especially<br>not ones from the wild-west!</h4>
		<h4>As you can most likely tell, Paul eventually gave in and accepted the new friends he had found! All of the people that are now part of<br>the band wanted Paul to teach them of his ways with music. Once they had all gathered their information, Paul sugested the idea of<br>starting a western band and so the KingStreetRunners was formed!</h4>
